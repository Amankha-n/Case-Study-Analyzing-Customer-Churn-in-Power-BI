# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

## Case Study Highlights

This hands-on case study focused on the fictitious telecom company, Databel, and provided invaluable insights into understanding and addressing customer churn. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what I accomplished:

### DAX Functions
Utilized basic DAX functions like `SWITCH` and `IF` statements to analyze data.

### Visualizations
Created an array of visuals including line charts, scatterplots, cards, maps, and various bar and column charts. In total, I developed around 17 visuals spread over 5 pages.

### Key Findings
- **Churn Rate**: Discovered that the churn rate for Databel was approximately 26.86%.
- **Top Reasons for Churn**: Identified that customers churned primarily due to better offers and devices from competitors, and dissatisfaction with customer support.
- **Regional Insights**: Found that California had the highest churn rate, but with only 68 customers, its impact might be minimal.
- **Contract Types**: Noted that customers with month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate at 46%.
- **Age Factor**: Observed that churn rate increased with age, indicating older customers were more likely to leave.
- **Customer Service Calls**: Determined that higher customer service interactions correlated with increased churn likelihood.

Though Databel is a fictitious company, the dataset reflected real-world scenarios, making this an incredibly engaging and educational experience.
